        The members of the Admin Council, with reference to section 02, are elected within
         the Degree Programs with at least three Admin. The mandate lasts 12 months, starting from the date of insertion on the Board, with 3 maximum possible mandate. The election takes place according to section 02,
        and the winner will be integrated into the Board of Directors as soon as the mandate of the previous director of the same course of studies expires.

        <br />

        In the event of the resignation of a member of the Council or of a delegate, a new vote will take place during the course. Following serious and harmful behavior of the Network or its spirit, each member of the Board or delegate may be disheartened by the Board itself or by the Admin of the reference study course, subject to the favorable opinion of at least 2/3 of the members of the same. In the case of the guarantors, the secret vote of the Board must be unanimous and subsequently a new appointment of the
        guarantor will be made by the previous one to the disheartened.</span>

During the call they will decide if the representative‚Äôs absence was motivated and/or excusable, and proceed accordingly planning.
