    <br />
    Definitions:
  <ul style="list-style: none; padding-left:20px;">
    <li>
      🔸 Internal person is one who has been in the group for a reasonable time and is part of the group in which he is (if he is in
      third tier of management engineering, then he really attends the third tier of management engineering).
    </li><li>
      🔸 An external person is a person who has just joined the group or who does not attend the reality of the group.</li>
  <li>🔸 Recognized Association and Representative List identified in reference to the University Register</li>
<li>
  🔸 Downgrading: principle of hierarchical descent in the roles of the Network due to serious events: who was delegate of the
  Network becomes simple Admin Advisor, who was Admin Advisor becomes simple Admin, who was Simple Admin becomes normal user,
   normal users are muted or banned.
</li>
</ul>
Rules:
<ul style="list-style: none; padding-left:20px;">
  <li>
    🔸 01. External spam, i.e. not coming from a group participant (one person enters and spam) is not tolerated. Those who do this will be banned from the entire Network.
  </li>
  <li>🔸 02. Peer dialogue (internal people) should be encouraged and not minimized.</li>
  <li>🔸 03. Internal spam, on the other hand, is tolerated if it does not become invasive (if everyone starts spamming, you have to
    discourage, but usually does not happen). Internal spam consists of:
  <ul><li>Members from the echelon who send thesis surveys;</li>
  <li>A link they find interesting about a project.</li></ul></li>
  <li>🔸 04. We must remember that the groups are Users: it is always preferable, if you see a problem
    (offensive discussions, heavy teasing ...), try to solve it in words (checking the contact according to the current privacy legislation,
    in case of repeated behavior you will be banned).
  </li>
    <li>🔸 05. Representatives on the programme boards (CCS) can unanimously use the groups of the
      Network of their course of study to ask to send communications, as well as every institution of the Politecnico di Milano (School,
      Presidents of the Degree Course Council etc ...) who ask us. The Network reserves the possibility, if it finds that the message
        is not appropriate (useful for students, directly or indirectly), to not accept the publication of the message.
    </li>

	<li>

	🔸 06. The President of the Student Council is allowed to propose to send communications
  in all the groups of the Network, subject to agreement with the Admin Council to determine the methods of dissemination.

	</li>

	<li>
      🔸 07. The Associations Recognized by the Politecnico di Milano and the Departmental Clubs whose activities are
      focused on specific Study Programs, they have the right to ask to send promotional messages to the groups they belong to.
      To be admitted to the list, the administrators of the degree program and the network must approve the thing.
      <br />The Associations Recognized by the Milan Polytechnic and Departmental Clubs that can do so are the following:
  <ul><li>Management Engineering Club - Management Engineering Courses</li>
  <li>AIM - Mathematical Engineers Association - Mathematical Engineering Studies Courses</li>
 <li>BEA - Biomedical Engineering Association - Biomedical Engineering Studies Courses</li>
	  <li>Dynamis PRC - Polimi Racing Division - Mechanical Engineering Studies Courses</li>
	  <li>Polifonia - Materials Engineering and Nanotechnology</li>
	</ul>

</li><li>
  🔸 08. The Associations Recognized by the Politecnico di Milano and the Departmental Clubs whose activities are focused
  to specific issues, they have the right to ask to send promotional messages in the groups they belong to
   in the extra groups of the network linked to them. To be admitted to the list, it is necessary to contact the Head of External Communication (for our network),
   after which the vote of the Admin Council will follow.
  <br />The Associations Recognized by the Milan Polytechnic and Departmental Clubs that can do so are the following:
  <ul>

    <li>Polifonia - Extra music group of the Network</li>
    <li>AESport -  Extra gaming group of the Network</li>
</ul>
</li><li>
  🔸 09. The dissemination of the news of Associations Recognized by the Politecnico di Milano, Club,
  Departments and Representative Lists is not allowed (except for what is written in this section, subsection 07 and 08).
  Publication is allowed in the dedicated system (@PoliAssociazioni, see Section 2),
  <br />In the event that a user independently decides to send news in the group of his reality, that is allowed,
  given that it is part of the dialogue between peers and it is understandable that a person finds an initiative or information interesting.
  However, if you see that a message from a reality is shared systematically, immediate action will be taken against the reality in question.
  <br />People on a Representative List who share a message from it will be downgraded.
  <br />Using the lists of users of the Network's groups to spam in private without explicit consent is, in addition to unlawful data processing, considered by us on a par with spam in the group itself.

</li>
<li>

  🔸 10. Measures
  <br />For minor infringements it is preferable to write to the person in chat, explaining where he went wrong and asking him not to
  redo it (by signing the contact according to the current privacy legislation, on telegram there is the possibility of
  remove the privilege of writing for days). Mild infringements are as follows:
  <ul >
  <li>Incorrect behavior (Section 1, subsection 4);

  </li><li>
    Internal Spam (Section 1, subsection 3).
  </li><li>
    Mild infringements repeated over time constitute a serious infringement
  </li>
  </ul>
  For serious infringements, on the other hand, the user must be banned from the whole PoliNetwork (if you have a role in the
  Network, then we proceed to the downgrading). Serious infringements are:
  <ul>
    <li>
      External Spam (Section 1, subsection 1);
</li>
  <li>
    Spam of Associations Recognized by the Polytechnic of Milan, Departmental Clubs and Representative Lists;
</li>
  <li>
    Serious offenses to Users.

</li>
</ul>

With regard to recognized associations, departmental clubs and representative lists: if one breaks the
   Spam rules will be taken against the whole reality:
<ul>
  <li>
    For a first offense, any post privileges in @PoliAssociazoni are revoked;
</li><li>
  At the second offense all the privileges are lost, even of the individual Users or of any Admin (they also lose the
  right to vote in the Board of Directors), decaying, and all the Admin of that reality are banned for 2 years
  (banned the entire reality for 2 years, due to violation of the rules, such as the spam of a reality during the pre-election and election campaign period).
</li>
</ul>
	</li><li>🔸 Recognition process for departmental clubs: <ul>
<li>A departmental club applies for one or more courses</li><li>
Requires unanimous approval of student representatives in CCS in each of the courses</li><li>
Opinion by majority of the Council</li><li>
If the vote is successful the club will have permission to ask the Network to send messages in the course group and its name will be added at rule 1.7 or 1.8.</li></ul></ul>

<span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is an extension of the @PoliRules</span></p>
<p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">The cleaning of the chat is a possible operation on Telegram, because the messages deleted in the
   supergroups are deleted for all at the same time. We also do it on Discord.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Why is cleaning performed?</span></p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c1">Imagine if a conversation about cats happened during the summer in the group. Maybe many like them, but a person who
  is preparing for the entrance test would not want to find certain messages while studying. So, what to do? The group is kept clean, that's all.
  However, there are groups to talk about non-school subjects, you can find them in <a href="../extra/index.html">@PoliExtra</a>. And there, even cats are welcome.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0">
<span class="c1">So do not worry if a message (or more) disappears, it can happen. If you think that your message should not have disappeared,
   do not write it in the group where it disappeared, write privately to the group administrator and discuss instead.</span></p><p class="c0">
     <span class="c1">This also applies to any discussions like "why did I get a warn?" or similar, they are all things to be discussed privately
       with the administrator, and if you are sent this kind of messages to the group, they will be removed as well.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0">
<span class="c1">Thanks, have fun in the @PoliNetwork</span></p>
