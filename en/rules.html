            <h2>Section 1: CONTENT AND MEASURES</h2>
                    <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Internal person is one who has been in the group for a reasonable time and is part
                    of the group in which he is (if he is in
                    third tier of management engineering, then he really attends the third tier of
                    management engineering).
                </li>
                <li>
                    An external person is a person who has just joined the group or who does not attend
                    the reality of the group.</li>
                <li>Recognized Association and Representative List identified in reference to the
                    University Register</li>
                <li>
                    Downgrading: principle of hierarchical descent in the roles of the Network due to
                    serious events: who was delegate of the
                    Network becomes simple Admin Advisor, who was Admin Advisor becomes simple Admin,
                    who was Simple Admin becomes normal user,
                    normal users are muted or banned.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    External spam, i.e. not coming from a group participant (one person enters and
                    spam) is not tolerated. Those who do this will be banned from the entire Network.
                </li>
                <li>Peer dialogue (internal people) should be encouraged and not minimized.</li>
                <li>Internal spam, on the other hand, is tolerated if it does not become invasive
                    (if everyone starts spamming, you have to
                    discourage, but usually does not happen). Internal spam consists of:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Members from the echelon who send thesis surveys;</li>
                        <li>A link they find interesting about a project.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>We must remember that the groups are Users: it is always preferable, if you see
                    a problem
                    (offensive discussions, heavy teasing ...), try to solve it in words (checking the
                    contact according to the current privacy legislation,
                    in case of repeated behavior you will be banned).
                </li>
                <li>Representatives on the programme boards (CCS) can unanimously use the groups of
                    the
                    Network of their course of study to ask to send communications, as well as every
                    institution of the Politecnico di Milano (School,
                    Presidents of the Degree Course Council etc ...) who ask us. The Network reserves
                    the possibility, if it finds that the message
                    is not appropriate (useful for students, directly or indirectly), to not accept the
                    publication of the message.
                </li>

                <li>

                    The President of the Student Council is allowed to propose to send
                    communications
                    in all the groups of the Network, subject to agreement with the Admin Council to
                    determine the methods of dissemination.

                </li>

                <li>
                    The Associations Recognized by the Politecnico di Milano and the Departmental
                    Clubs whose activities are
                    focused on specific Study Programs, they have the right to ask to send promotional
                    messages to the groups they belong to.
                    To be admitted to the list, the administrators of the degree program and the network
                    must approve the thing.
                    <br />The Associations Recognized by the Milan Polytechnic and Departmental Clubs
                    that can do so are the following:
                    <ul>

                        <li>BEA - Biomedical Engineering Association - Biomedical Engineering Studies
                            Courses</li>
                        <li>Dynamis PRC - Polimi Racing Division - Mechanical Engineering Studies

                <li>
                    The Associations Recognized by the Politecnico di Milano and the Departmental
                    Clubs whose activities are focused
                    to specific issues, they have the right to ask to send promotional messages in the
                    groups they belong to
                    in the extra groups of the network linked to them. To be admitted to the list, it is
                    necessary to contact the Head of External Communication (for our network),
                    after which the vote of the Admin Council will follow.
                    <br />The Associations Recognized by the Milan Polytechnic and Departmental Clubs
                    that can do so are the following:
                    <ul>

                        <li>Polifonia - Extra music group of the Network</li>
                        <li>AESport - Extra gaming group of the Network</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The dissemination of the news of Associations Recognized by the Politecnico di
                    Milano, Club,
                    Departments and Representative Lists is not allowed (except for what is written in
                    this section, subsection 07 and 08).
                    Publication is allowed in the dedicated system (@PoliAssociazioni, see Section 2),
                    <br />In the event that a user independently decides to send news in the group of
                    his reality, that is allowed,
                    given that it is part of the dialogue between peers and it is understandable that a
                    person finds an initiative or information interesting.
                    However, if you see that a message from a reality is shared systematically,
                    immediate action will be taken against the reality in question.
                    <br />People on a Representative List who share a message from it will be
                    downgraded.

                </li>
                <li>

                    Measures
                    <br />For minor infringements it is preferable to write to the person in chat,
                    explaining where he went wrong and asking him not to
                    redo it (by signing the contact according to the current privacy legislation, on
                    telegram there is the possibility of
                    remove the privilege of writing for days). Mild infringements are as follows:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Incorrect behavior (Section 1, subsection 4);

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Internal Spam (Section 1, subsection 3).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Mild infringements repeated over time constitute a serious infringement
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    For serious infringements, on the other hand, the user must be banned from the whole
                    PoliNetwork (if you have a role in the
                    Network, then we proceed to the downgrading). Serious infringements are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            External Spam (Section 1, subsection 1);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Spam of Associations Recognized by the Polytechnic of Milan, Departmental
                            Clubs and Representative Lists;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Serious offenses to Users.

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    With regard to recognized associations, departmental clubs and representative lists:
                    if one breaks the
                    Spam rules will be taken against the whole reality:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            For a first offense, any post privileges in @PoliAssociazoni are revoked;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At the second offense all the privileges are lost, even of the individual
                            Users or of any Admin (they also lose the
                            right to vote in the Board of Directors), decaying, and all the Admin of
                            that reality are banned for 2 years
                            (banned the entire reality for 2 years, due to violation of the rules, such
                            as the spam of a reality during the pre-election and election campaign
                            period).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Recognition process for departmental clubs: <ul>
                        <li>A departmental club applies for one or more courses</li>
                        <li>
                            Requires unanimous approval of student representatives in CCS in each of the
                            courses</li>
                        <li>
                            Opinion by majority of the Council</li>
                        <li>
                            If the vote is successful the club will have permission to ask the Network
                            to send messages in the course group and its name will be added at rule 1.7
                            or 1.8.</li>
                    </ul>

            <p>Section 2: SPONSORING</p>
            <p>Advertisment posts are not allowed to prevent spam on our group.</p>
            <p>With the sentence above, we mean that no unauthorized spam should appear in the chat or in the group
                (whether in
                the name, in the message content, etc.). </p>
            <p>We have developed a special system for the associations of the Politecnico, and it is the following:
                they can publish,
                by contacting us on our Facebook page, a photo with description regarding their event, in the
                channel <a href="https://t.me/PoliAssociazioni">@PoliAssociazioni</a> in
                Telegram and other social media platforms. From there, together with them, we will discuss which
                groups make sense to forward their post to. In this way,
                the channel will grow and become a reference point for the excellent initiatives that the various
                associations propose.</p>
            <p>For any exceptions or in case you are not part of the previously listed categories please contact us
                with a private message

            <p>Section 3: ⚪️⚪️ CLEANING CHAT ⚪️⚪️&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The administrators will clean the chat silently from any heavy Out Topic, flame and messages against
                the regulation, in
                order to ensure the best possible quality for the community, respecting all users.The cleaning issue
                is better
                explained in the CHAT CLEANING EXTENSION (see below)</p>

                <span class="c14 c6">Section 4: 🔴🔴 BAN and SECURITY 🔴🔴 </p>
            <p>Users that will not behave correctly and will repeatedly break the poli rules, will be banned from
                the groups, following the <b>section 1: CONTENT AND MEASURES</b>.</p>

                behaviour towards you in private
                chat, contact the admins.</p>
            <p>The better your conduct in the group will be, the greater the tolerance towards you in case of any
                mistakes in good faith will be.
                The ban will always be considered extrema ratio by the admin (except for what written in other
                sections in this rules)

            <p><span>EXTENSION [CHAT CLEANING] 🧹
            </p>
            <p>This is an extension of the @PoliRules</p>

            <p>The cleaning of the chat is a possible operation on Telegram, because the messages deleted in the
                supergroups are deleted for all at the same time. We also do it on Discord.</p>
            <p>Why is cleaning performed?</p>
            <p>
                Imagine if a conversation about cats happened during the summer in the group. Maybe many like them,
                but a person who
                is preparing for the entrance test would not want to find certain messages while studying. So, what
                to do? The group is kept clean, that's all.
                However, there are groups to talk about non-school subjects, you can find them in <a
                    href="../extra/index.html">@PoliExtra</a>. And there, even cats are welcome.</p>
            <p>
                So do not worry if a message (or more) disappears, it can happen. If you think that your message
                should not have disappeared,
                do not write it in the group where it disappeared, write privately to the group administrator and
                discuss instead.
                This also applies to any discussions like "why did I get a warn?" or similar, they are all things to
                be discussed privately
                with the administrator, and if you are sent this kind of messages to the group, they will be removed
                as well.
                Thanks, have fun in the @PoliNetwork</p>
