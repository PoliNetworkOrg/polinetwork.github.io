Upload

This guide was compiled by <a class="accent" href="https://t.me/eliamaggioni">@EliaMaggioni</a> to help you in the use of <a class="accent" href="https://t.me/PoliMaterial_bot">t.me/PoliMaterial_bot</a>.<br>
The bot allows you to upload material directly into your course's GitLab folder to help your current and future colleagues.
Uploading course-related material makes it easier for the future.<br>.
Find all available courses <a class="accent" href="./view/">here</a>

###How do I upload the material?
TELEGRAM https://t.me/PoliMaterial_bot
MANIFEST https://gitlab.com/polinetwork/
To upload material, navigate the folders to your course of study using the buttons offered by the bot. Then select the year and navigate to the desired folder.
When you've reached the point you want, click the "ðŸ†— Current Folder" button.<br>
At this point the bot is ready to accept your files, upload one or multiple files.<br>
A notification will be sent to you when the files are uploaded, please wait 2 to 20 minutes before reporting a malfunction.

Please note, due to Telegram limitations, the maximum uploadable capacity is 20MB. We are working to increase it. In this case you will get an error message saying that
that the bot can't upload the file, however an admin will take care of it by hand. Keep in mind that the time will be longer.

###Where do the files go?
MANIFEST https://gitlab.com/polinetwork/
All files uploaded and approved by an admin end up in the GitLab folder selected during upload.<br>.
You can find them all in the link above or in the <a href="./view" class="accent"> view</a> section.

###How does approval work?
Once you submit the file and receive confirmation from the bot, an admin will review the file to make sure it can be uploaded to the indicated location.<br>.
If the verification is successful, the material will be approved, you will be notified by the bot and the material will appear in the course folder without your further actions.<br>
If the verification fails, the material will be discarded. In case you have a non-hidden account, you will be contacted by the admin to inform you of the reasons, which can also be trivial as having the wrong upload folder.
